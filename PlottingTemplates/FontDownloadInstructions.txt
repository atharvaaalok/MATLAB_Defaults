The toolbox uses Nunito as the font for plotting.

To check if your matlab version has it installed run the following lines in your command window:
>> d = listfonts

If your system does not have the font then follow these simple steps to download/install it:
1) Download from google fonts here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito
OR
2) Use the fonts I have provided in the ColorsAndFonts/NunitoFonts folder
Copy the provided .ttf files and save in the following location:
C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2022a\sys\java\jre\win64\jre\lib\fonts
Then right click each file and choose open with "Windows Font Viewer". Then choose the install option available on the top.

// This feature is under development:
You can use any font for your figures. To do this simply download the corresponding .ttf files for that font and follow the steps as explained in 2).


Re-run matlab and you are ready to go!!!
